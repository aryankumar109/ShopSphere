The "Not Found" error usually means that the server could not locate the project files in the expected directory. Let’s go through some checks to make sure everything is set up correctly:

Verify the Directory Path:

Ensure that the project folder online-shopping-system-with-advanced-admin-page-master is correctly placed in C:\xampp\htdocs\.
The full path should look like this:
sql
Copy code
C:\xampp\htdocs\online-shopping-system-with-advanced-admin-page-master
Check the URL in Browser:

Open your browser and try navigating to:
perl
Copy code
http://localhost/online-shopping-system-with-advanced-admin-page-master
Ensure there are no typos in the URL.
Restart Apache:

Go to the XAMPP Control Panel and restart the Apache server. Sometimes, a restart helps the server recognize newly added project files.
Check Apache Configuration (if necessary):

If the issue persists, it could be related to your Apache configuration.
Open httpd.conf in C:\xampp\apache\conf\ and check that DocumentRoot is set to C:/xampp/htdocs.
Ensure the <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs"> directive allows access.
Clear Browser Cache:

Sometimes the browser caches errors. Clear your browser’s cache or try using an incognito window.
Access the Directory Directly:

Go to http://localhost/ and look for a directory listing. If you see online-shopping-system-with-advanced-admin-page-master, click on it to access the project.
Let me know if any of these steps resolve the issue or if the problem persists, and we can troubleshoot further!

Since your project directory is not in C:\xampp\htdocs, Apache cannot access it directly. To resolve this, you have two options:

Option 1: Move the Project to XAMPP's htdocs Directory
Copy or Move the online-shopping-system folder to C:\xampp\htdocs\.
After moving, your project path should look like:
makefile
Copy code
C:\xampp\htdocs\online-shopping-system
Then, access the project in your browser at:
perl
Copy code
http://localhost/online-shopping-system
Option 2: Create an Alias in Apache (If you Prefer to Keep the Project in the Current Directory)
Open httpd.conf in C:\xampp\apache\conf\ using a text editor.
Add an alias for your project at the end of the file:
apache
Copy code
Alias /online-shopping-system "C:/Users/pkpri/OneDrive/Documents/aryandp2/college_placement/project/clone/online-shopping-system"
<Directory "C:/Users/pkpri/OneDrive/Documents/aryandp2/college_placement/project/clone/online-shopping-system">
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
Save httpd.conf and restart Apache in the XAMPP control panel.
Now, visit:
perl
Copy code
http://localhost/online-shopping-system
Let me know if either solution works!
